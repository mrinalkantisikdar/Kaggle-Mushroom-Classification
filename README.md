# Kaggle-Mushroom-Classification
Machine Learning Mushroom Classification Project using UCI MACHINE LEARNING data from Kaggle. The aim of the project is to classify and predict edible or poisonous mushroom species.

Seven different machine learning algorithms are used in this project:
1. Logistic Regression Classifier
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
3. Decision Tree Classifier
4. Random Forest Classifier
5. k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
6. Naive Bayes Classifier
7. XGBoost Classifier
